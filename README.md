# How to use

## First Way: Through command line argument

```bash
.\CppCompetitiveTemplateCreator.exe example.cpp
```
You can also use full path like this

```bash
.\CppCompetitiveTemplateCreator.exe "C:\Users\anhdu\Desktop\example.cpp"
```

## Second Way if you don't use command line argument

Just input the file path and name (If there's no path then it will be stored in the same directory
